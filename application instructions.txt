Application Instructions
==================
In order to run the server:
1. Download server side folder from booksCrud to a local folder in your computer and add a node_modules folder (not include due to space).
2. Run the following terminal command: node server.js
! Note - Because I used axios, I had a problem with CROSS ORIGIN so I used a Chrome plugin (Moesif Origin & CORS Changer) to overcome the problem !

In order to run the client:
1. Download all files in booksCrud folder to a local folder in your computer and add a node_modules folder (not include due to space).
2. Run the following terminal command: npm start

! Note !
1. The projects do not include the node modules folder.
2. A BOOTSTRAP installation is required if it does not exist (terminal command: npm install bootstrap).
